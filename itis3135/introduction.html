            <li>Inspirational Quote: To be weird is to be unique</li>
            <li>Personal Background: I was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. Both of my
                parents are from Laos, a Southeastern Asian country that I feel little connection with,
                other than somewhat understanding the Lao language when it is spoken by my parents
                at home.</li>
            <li>Professional Background: I started helping my parents with a small grocery store my
                parents obtained when I was in middle school (child labor? jk) with small tasks such as
                stocking shelves and running the cash register, and to this day I still help with those
                sorts of tasks at a similar store in a different location owned by my parents.</li>
            <li>Academic Background: Started preschool when I was four years old. Attended
                kindergarten, elementary, middle, and high school. Went to this university during the
                2021 fall semester a few months after graduating high school. I plan on graduating in
                2025 during Spring.</li>
            <li>Background in this Subject: I have taken the Intro to Comp Sci. I & II courses, and I have
                designed an app before for my high school coding club. Nothing with designing websites
                though :(</li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: Windows 10 (tried Windows 11, it was too much for my laptop)</li>
            <li>Courses I'm Taking & Why:
                <ul>
                    <li>ITIS 3135 - Web-Based Application Design and Development: Recommended by my
                        academic advisor for the cybersecurity concentration, and I figured it would
                        be fun learning how to make web apps.</li>
                    <li>ITIS 3200 - Intro to Info Security & Priv: Recommended by my academic advisor for
                        the cybersecurity concentration, and it could also be useful since I’m currently
                        hoping to protect information in the future.</li>
                    <li>ITSC 3155 - Software Engineering: Recommended by my academic advisor for the
                        cybersecurity concentration, and the title sounded cool.</li>
                    <li>ITSC 3181 - Intro to Comp Architecture: Recommended by my academic advisor for
                        the cybersecurity concentration. What, were you expecting more?</li>
                    <li>MATH 1242 - Calculus II: Because apparently, Calculus I wasn’t enough mental
                        torture for me. And because I love repeating myself, it was recommended by my
                        academic advisor for the cybersecurity concentration.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by: If ya couldn’t tell by my classy nickname
                and my demeanor in the text above, I’m a silly one. Also, read the line below</li>
            <li>I'd also like to Share: I like Minecraft. Was first exposed to it sometime during middle
                school while watching YouTube. Was very excited when I first got Minecraft sometime
                during high school. Haven’t played it as much as I used to recently but it still has a
                place in my heart :D</li>
